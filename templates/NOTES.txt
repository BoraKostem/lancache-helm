1. Configure Your Network DNS

{{- if .Values.dns.service.loadBalancerIP }}
You have specified a LoadBalancer IP for your DNS service.

To use this DNS server, configure your router or PC's primary DNS to:

    {{ .Values.dns.service.loadBalancerIP }}

This will direct all DNS queries to your deployed service.

{{- else }}
You have not set a LoadBalancer IP for the DNS service.

To retrieve the IP assigned by your provider, run:

    kubectl get svc {{ .Release.Name }} -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}"

Once you have the external IP, configure it as the primary DNS server on your router or PC.

Note: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to become available.
{{- end }}

2. Verify DNS Resolution

After setting the DNS, you can test it by running:

    nslookup steam.cache.lancache.net

This should return the IP address of your DNS server is functioning correctly.
